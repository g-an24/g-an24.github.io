#  Custom ResNet for CIFAR-10 Image Classification

The Custom ResNet for CIFAR-10 project develops a highly efficient Residual Network with under 5 million parameters. The model optimizes layer depth and filter sizes for a balance of complexity and accuracy. Advanced techniques such as AdamW optimization, learning rate scheduling, and extensive data augmentation (e.g., random cropping, flipping, rotation) enhance training stability and generalization. This project showcases a high-performance image classification model specifically tuned for CIFAR-10.
