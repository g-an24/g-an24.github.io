# Sentiment Insight for Finance


The Sentiment Insight for Finance project focuses on classifying financial statements as positive or negative using advanced Large Language Models (LLMs). By fine-tuning LLaMA 3 8b and Mistral v3 7b models with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and 4-bit quantization, the project achieves efficient and high-performance sentiment analysis tailored for the financial domain.
