#  NYU Assistant

This project develops a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for the NYU community, combining advanced NLP techniques with modern web technologies to address a variety of inquiries. The system features real-time data scraping from NYU resources to ensure up-to-date information, fast and accurate data retrieval using FAISS vector embeddings, and optimized reranking with FlashRank. Built with LangChain and llama3-8b for robust NLP workflows, and an interactive Streamlit web application, it delivers precise, contextually relevant responses and enhances user engagement.
