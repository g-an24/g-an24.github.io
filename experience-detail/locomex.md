# Machine Learning Engineer Intern
**LOCOMeX**
June 2024 - August 2024
<br>

As a current Machine Learning and Data Science Intern at LOCOMeX, I have been working on several impactful projects. I have trained and deployed XGBoost and Random Forest models using AWS Sagemaker, optimizing performance and scalability, while achieving an impressive 80% accuracy in predicting a companyâ€™s social score based on ITA-defined parameters. 
<br>
Additionally, I designed and implemented ETL pipelines using AWS Lambda functions to efficiently extract, transform, and load data from S3 buckets, resulting in enhanced data accessibility and streamlined processing workflows. I also enahnced a semantic search model on AWS using Pinecone, leveraging all-distilroberta-v1 embeddings and cosine similarity analysis to accurately match suppliers with RFP requirements, ensuring precise and relevant supplier recommendations. These experiences have equipped me with a robust skill set in machine learning, data science, and cloud computing.
<br>
In another project, I am conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on healthcare datasets using pandas and seaborn, leveraging AWS S3 and Glue for data storage and ETL processes. This analysis is essential for uncovering patterns and insights that inform our predictive models.

Through these efforts, I am contributing to LOCOMex's mission to provide innovative ESG solutions.
