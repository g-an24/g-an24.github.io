# Data Analyst Intern
**OnActuate**
June 2021 - July 2021
<br>

At OnActuate, I was deeply involved in projects that enhanced data visualization and decision-making processes for clients. My primary focus was on developing and deploying interactive data solutions using advanced tools and platforms.
<br>
I developed over 25 interactive PowerBI data visualizations aimed at enhancing client decision-making through in-depth analysis. These visualizations provided clients with clear, actionable insights, enabling them to make informed business decisions.
<br>
Additionally, I leveraged Azure Data Factory for data integration, ensuring seamless and efficient data flow across various sources. I utilized Azure SQL Database for managing and querying large datasets, which was crucial for handling the extensive data needs of our clients.
<br>
Furthermore, I deployed Power BI reports on Azure, enabling scalable and secure data sharing. This deployment ensured that clients could access their data visualizations reliably and securely, promoting trust and confidence in our solutions.
<br>
Through these efforts, I significantly contributed to OnActuate's ability to provide robust data analytics solutions, improving client satisfaction and helping them achieve their business goals through better data-driven decisions.
