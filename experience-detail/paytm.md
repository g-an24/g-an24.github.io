# Machine Learning Engineer Intern

During my internship at Paytm, I played a pivotal role in the development and enhancement of the electronic Know Your Customer (e-KYC) process, a crucial initiative introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic to enable users to activate their Paytm accounts from the comfort of their homes.
<br>
One of my key contributions was boosting facial liveness detection accuracy to 93.4% by integrating MobileNetV2 with a self-engineered CNN model. This enhancement was vital for ensuring the security and reliability of system, helping to prevent fraudulent activities.
<br>
To further streamline the e-KYC process, I created an OCR Flask application utilizing Tesseract for accurate text extraction from user-uploaded IDs. This application automated the verification process, making it more efficient and accurate.
<br>
Additionally, I implemented observability for various services using NewRelic, Prometheus, and Grafana. This implementation ensured compliance with MLOps best practices, enabling real-time monitoring and enhancing the reliability and performance of the deployed machine learning models.
<br>
Through these efforts, I played a key role in improving Paytm's e-KYC process, making it more secure, efficient, and reliable. This project was particularly significant during the pandemic, as it allowed users to conveniently and safely activate their Paytm accounts from home, ensuring seamless access to essential financial services.
